# EyePointer

EyePointer is an open-source project that enables users to control their mouse cursor with their eyes. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, EyePointer tracks eye movements and translates them into precise cursor movements, allowing users to interact with their computer in a hands-free and intuitive way.

## Features

- **Real-time eye tracking and cursor movement**
- **Adjustable sensitivity and accuracy settings**
- **Support for multiple eye tracking models and algorithms**
- **Compatible with various operating systems and devices**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
