EyePointer

A Revolutionary Eye-Controlled Mouse Project

Overview

EyePointer is an open-source project that enables users to control their mouse cursor with their eyes. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, EyePointer tracks eye movements and translates them into precise cursor movements, allowing users to interact with their computer in a hands-free and intuitive way.

Features

- Real-time eye tracking and cursor movement
- Adjustable sensitivity and accuracy settings
- Support for multiple eye tracking models and algorithms
- Compatible with various operating systems and devices

Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies: OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the python EyeMotion.py script to start the application.

Usage

1. Look at the screen and move your eyes to control the cursor.
2. Adjust the sensitivity and accuracy settings as needed.
3. Use the Esc key to exit the application.
